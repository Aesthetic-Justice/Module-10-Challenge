## Description

This app is a command-line based, interactive tool. Built using the inquirer package, this tool takes in a set list of information criteria from the user and exports an HTML file which neatly displays employee data. Additionally, this application is test-driven, with a high amount of test coverage thanks to the Jest package. In the root directory is a file called "ExampleOutput.html", those interested in this tool can load that within a browser to get an idea of what the final output of this tool will look like.

## Installation Instructions

Thanks to Node Package Manager, everything required to install and run the application is contained internally. Simply open the terminal and run the command "npm install".

## Usage Information

To use the application, the user must first seed the database using the command "npm run seed". Then, spin-up the locally hosted instance by running the "index.js" file in the main branch using the included command "npm run start". Finally, send requests to the port indicated by readout in the terminal (3030 by default).
